Part of: MBA, York St. John University

Project Components:

Research Document: A 12,000-word detailed analysis.
Poster Presentation: A concise, one-slide visual summary.

2. Research Document

Description: As part of my MBA at York St. John University, this research analyzes how Net Profit Margin (NPM), Return on Assets (ROA), and Current Ratio (CR) impact stock returns in the Finance and Credit Services sector of the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). It also investigates whether Dividend Payout Ratio (DPR) and Debt to Asset Ratio (DAR) moderate these relationships. The analysis is based on 5 years of data (2019-2023) from 10 companies.

Word Count: 12,000 words

Quantitative Analysis: This study primarily uses quantitative analysis to investigate relationships between financial ratios (NPM, ROA, CR) and stock returns. The statistical techniques employed include multiple regression analysis to determine the significance and strength of the independent variables (NPM, ROA, CR) on stock returns and the moderating effects of DPR and DAR. Hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and interaction terms are included to thoroughly examine these relationships.

Tools Used:

MS Excel: It was used for initial data organization, cleaning, and preliminary analysis. It was essential for calculating financial ratios (NPM, ROA, CR, DPR, DAR) from raw data such as financial statements. Basic trend analysis and visualizations, such as stock price trends and ratio changes over the years, were also generated in Excel to support the deeper statistical analysis in SPSS.

SPSS: It was used for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing. Regression models were built to assess the influence of NPM, ROA, and CR on stock returns, and interaction terms were included to evaluate the moderating effects of DPR and DAR. Various diagnostic tests such as multicollinearity checks, Breusch-Pagan tests for heteroskedasticity, and residual analysis were conducted to ensure the validity of the regression models.


3. Poster Presentation

Description: This poster was created to summarize the key points of my research for presentations and academic discussions. It visually presents the core findings and the relationships between the variables in a clear and accessible format.
